# haskell-ogar

This is a client for [Ogar](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar) -- the open source
[Agar.io](http://agar.io/) clone. The goal is to test out various AI solutions
for playing the game.

## Installation
I used [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) and standard
stack workflow applies here:
```bash
stack build
stack exec haskell-ogar-exe
```
